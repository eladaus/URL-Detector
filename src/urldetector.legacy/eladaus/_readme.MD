
Files in this folder are created by Dale Holborow (eladaus oy) to as quickly as possible substitute/port typical Java functionality from the 
LinkedIn source project that inspired this work, into a functional .NET equivalent.

As much as possible, I keep the files in the root folder and the /detection folder as similar to their Java original, to aid in the comparison and debugging process

Long-term, and to really squeeze out additional performance, could/should/I have replace(d) with .NET native functions (e.g. the string.isEmpty overloads)
